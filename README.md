# Computer Programming in C
Upon successful completion of the course, the student must:  

• Understand the syntax of the C language and be familiar with the Integrated Development Environment (eg. editor, compiler, software libraries, reference manuals, online help)  
• Construct with relative ease the basic programming statements: data types, variables, constants, value assignments, expressions, loops and control structures  
• Understand and be able to use abstract data types (arrays, strings), functions, recursion, scope of variables, pointers and structures  
• Use and be familiar with formatted input/output, the C preprocessor, files and the arguments of main  
• Be able to analyze computer programs developed in C language and define their operation  
• Be able to design and apply problem solutions on the computer through C programming  

**Lab**: Laboratory assignments and the final exam constitute 30% of the total grade.  

I will obviously not be uploading the introductory programs I wrote in order to learn if statements  
or loops. I'm uploading some programs of intermediate difficulty that showcase understanding of  
pointers, functions and structs as well as a really hard one and one that I really enjoyed creating,  
both marked with '!'.
